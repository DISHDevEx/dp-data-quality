## Glue catalog validation: 
___
## Main purpose:
The main purpose of Glue Validation module is to validate Glue Catalog generated by Crawler by comparing Glue Database with S3 Bucket. When a user uses Glue Crawler to generate Glue Database based on S3 bucket, the module scans the S3 bucket and compares the tables under this bucket with tables under Glue Database. The result of comparison is saved in the same S3 bucket and an email with results is sent to the subscribers of SNS.


### 2 files:
**glue_catalog_validation.py**:
This file will generate two lists by scanning target S3 bucket and reading from Glue Catalog Database. Glue Catalog Database must exist before running Glue Validation module and name of Glue Catalog Database and target S3 bucket must be the same.
Glue Catalog Crawler will transform all punctuations into underscore convert all uppercase to lowercase when crawling S3 to generate tables in Glue Database.
Validation result will be save in the same S3 bucket under folder of 'glue_database_validation' and an alert email will be sent to the subscribers of the SNS.

**glue_catalog_validation.yaml**:
This file can be used to create Glue Job role, Glue Job and SNS topic, and their name should follow naming convention rules.
Python code should sit (glue_catalog_validation.py) at the S3 bucket's top level.
SNS topic will send out results to subscribers by emails.
Sample stackname: aws-5g--dp--mss--data-science--dev---gluevalidation (Details in README)

## Steps to implement Glue Validation module:
**Prerequisites**:
Access to AWS account, AWS Glue, AWS S3, AWS SNS and AWS CloudFormation. Glue Database has the same name as the S3 bucket.

**Steps**:
1. Upload Python file (glue_catalog_validation.py) to S3 bucket's top level.
2. Upload YAML file (glue_catalog_validation.yaml) from local machine (or S3) to CloudFormation to deploy stack, create Glue Job and SNS topic. Stackname must contain target S3 Bucket name and must be in format <target bucket name (replace dot with two dashes)>---gluevalidation to create Glue Job role, Glue Job and SNS topic. Stackname should be <dish aws account name (replace dot with two dashes)>---gluevalidation
3. In AWS Glue, run glue job with name same as stackname mentioned above to trigger the validation work.
4. Results should be saved in same S3 under 'glue_database_validation' folder, and an alert will be sent to metadq@dish.com. (more emails can be added in SNS)
5. Once one validation work is done, the stack must be deleted in CloudFormation.

Example of stackname for glue_catalog_validation.yaml:
account name -> aws-5g.dp.mss.data-science.dev
stack name -> data--quality--bucket---gluevalidation
target bucket name -> data.quality.bucket

## Future work:
Should learn how to get Glue Job run automatically from some kind of trigger.
